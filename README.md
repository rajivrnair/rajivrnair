### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rajiv

I'm a programmer who loves cats, coffee and anything with dangerously high levels of saturated fats. If you've worked with me before, well, insanity is my only defence :smile_cat:

I have been working for over eighteen years across the finance, construction, automobile and telecom domains and have played diverse business and technical roles ranging from hands-on development to helping our clients elucidate new requirements, building proof-of-concept pieces and analyse their impact on existing applications. I have also been responsible for design, infrastructure and performance on my projects.
